            <p>Everyone has their own sort of character. We as a whole demonstration with a specific goal in mind that makes us what our identity is. It is accepted that our folks, peers and, the earth we experience childhood in, shape us. Character is portrays as a blend of feelings, disposition, and personal conduct standards of a person. There is an explanation that we are how we are and there are numerous hypotheses that accompany that.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Born and raised in Rwanda, and I am a student at Davis college Akilah Campus in Information system.

              I joined this IT faculty in 2017 and I am excited to graduate in 2021. I am a very enthusiastic person who likes to learn new things so as to improve on my skills. I have learnt to be a good leader through helping out my friends and other colleagues.  I joined this field because it I have always wanted to do it as a career. As a student I like to get more involved in website development and networking because it challenges me into learning new software applications. My skills include leaderships, programming language and communication skills. Throughout my years of studies I have developed an app to help people upload their CVs for job seeking. This app will help job seekers to upload their CVs without knowing what the employers are looking for hence not lying about skills they don't have. I want to become a software engineer where I will be developing systems that will be helping people in their everyday life.</p>
